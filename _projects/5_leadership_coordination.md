Across my career, I have played a central leadership role in translating advanced computing and data science methods into biomedical impact by coordinating large, multidisciplinary teams spanning national laboratories, federal agencies, and academic institutions.

## Leadership Experience

I have managed and directed projects totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, aligning scientific goals with sustainable infrastructure and software development.

### Major Programs Led
- **MVP-CHAMPION**: $27M VA-DOE collaboration
- **PALISADE-X**: $2.5M DOE/ASCR privacy-enhancing technologies
- **Globus Genomics R01**: $1.58M NHGRI infrastructure
- **Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid**: $5M (part of $100M program)
- **Multiple NIH initiatives**: Big Data to Knowledge, cardiovascular genomics

## Impact

Through programs such as MVP-CHAMPION and multiple NIH initiatives, I have helped bridge the gap between method development and real-world biomedical application, ensuring that advances in HPC, AI, and data infrastructure directly support scientific discovery and clinical relevance.

This leadership-driven contribution has enabled durable research ecosystems that continue to support innovation beyond individual projects.
