I have made foundational contributions to the design and deployment of national biomedical cyberinfrastructure that enables secure, scalable data sharing and analysis across institutions. I directed and managed several major NIH-funded projects, establishing widely adopted architectures for federated data access, workflow execution, and identity-aware data movement.

## Major Projects

### NCI Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG)
Led infrastructure development for secure data sharing across NCI-designated cancer centers nationwide.

### NHLBI CVRGrid
Developed cardiovascular research grid infrastructure enabling collaborative analysis across institutions.

### NHGRI Globus Genomics R01
Created a platform that enabled researchers without advanced computational expertise to perform reproducible next-generation sequencing analyses at scale, accelerating genomics research across diverse institutions.

## Impact

These platforms influenced how biomedical research communities think about interoperability, sustainability, and reuse of computational tools and data resources. Globus Genomics, in particular, served thousands of users analyzing millions of genomes and led to a successful commercial spinoff.
