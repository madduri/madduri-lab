Ravi Madduri is a Senior Scientist and Group Leader at Argonne National Laboratory, where he leads research in computational science, artificial intelligence, and biomedical data analysis. His work focuses on developing scalable solutions for large-scale scientific computing, with emphasis on privacy-preserving federated learning, GPU-accelerated genomics, and AI-driven biomedical research.

His research spans multiple domains:
- **High-Performance Computing**: Development of distributed systems and data infrastructure for scientific applications
- **Privacy-Preserving AI**: Building federated learning frameworks for collaborative biomedical research
- **Computational Genomics**: GPU-accelerated analysis of large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data
- **Scientific Workflows**: Creating reproducible pipelines for biomedical and scientific computing

Dr. Madduri has published over 150 papers in leading journals and conferences, contributing to foundational advances in computational infrastructure, bioinformatics, and AI applications for healthcare. His work on frameworks like APPFL and MapperTrac enables privacy-preserving collaboration across institutions while maintaining high-performance capabilities.

Current research interests include scaling AI models for biomedical applications, developing privacy-preserving methods for cross-institutional collaboration, and optimizing computational infrastructure for next-generation scientific discovery.
